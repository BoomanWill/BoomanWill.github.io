                <p>A couple of weeks ago I came across <a href="https://penteract.github.io/pythagTree.html">this</a> site having watched a livestream by James Munro on twitch where he went through the page and tried to understand what was going on.</p><p>Basically, a PhD student at MIT had used whats called a discrete finite automaton to calculate the area of the pythagoras tree, a fractal which, due to a complicated set of overlapping squares, no one had found the area of. On his livestream, James Munro used a much simpler example which he called the cat fractal to understand the method, which I will attempt to present in writing here.</p>
